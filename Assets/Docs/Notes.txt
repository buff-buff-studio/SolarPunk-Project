- CREATING MULTIPLAYER GAMES IS HARD, ISSUES MAY HAPPEN
- IF I CHANGED SOMETHING IS TO IMPROVE THE SYNCHRONIZATION
- I CHANGED THE PLAYER-PLATFORM INTERACTION CAUSE I ALREADY HAD THE SAME ISSUES A FEW TIMES ON OTHER PROJECTS

Cable / Circuit Changes:
    - No Errors Anymore / Reliable References
    - New UI / Editor
    - You can select multiple points at once
    - You can move multiple points at once
    - You can move between points using arrows
    - You can undo / redo selections
    - You can use A to select / deselect - all
    - You can edit the curve of the first and the last control point
    - You can now customize the returned data from a component to create custom components (just remember that return values are not synced through network)
    - You can create wireless cables
    - You can create wireless antennas
    - New prefab list
    - Cables now use shock vfx to show if there's power going through them 
        - Physical and Standard Cables
    - Sockets can now be self powered

New Additions / Changes:
    - Spawn point system. Just create the spawn points and voil√°
    - Game Manager now has buttons to control the game flow
    - Zipline and platform now uses interfaces (IHeavyObject and IMagneticObject) to interact with objects. Fixed Inheritance for the new system
    - Improved player movement while in claw / platform, solving sync problems
    - Created SO for emotes. Avoid creating big classes directly into the inspector
    - Emotes now uses the SolisSessionData to save emotes
    - Player classes are now separated in scripts and prefabs. We talked about this in some moment, and we decided to separate the scripts, but it was not done
    - Network Manager was scattered through many scenes. Fixed it
    - The menu / lobby flow was completely redone. Now it's easier to understand and works with the new system
    - (I DID NOT MADE ANY UI, IT'S JUST FOR TESTING PURPOSES. SERGIO CAN CUSTOMIZE IT FROM NOW ON)

Warnings:
    - Attention when using Invoke / Cancel Invoke and Register / Unregister Events
    - Check if hot reload is working properly with the new changes
    - Do not use Coroutines, and Async Methods careless. Everything must be synchronized and hot reload must work properly
    - Do not use DoTween for anything other than UI animations and vfx / game juices. It's not synced through network
    - Avoid use lists to save states, mainly when the list stores objects.
        - Zipline does not stores a list of magnetized objects anymore. It uses interfaces to interact with objects, and each object is responsible for its own state
        - If a player disconnects while in the zipline, no issues will happen
        
TO-DO (By Me):
    - Cutscene flow system
    - Fix Stuttering on moving cables and objects on claws
    
TO-DO (By Others):
    - Check if hot-reload is working with your changes
    - Check if everything is synced
        - If not, try regenerating the NetworkIdentity and check if it's working
    - Follow the code formatting (Assets/Docs/CodeGuide.txt)
 
Question:
    - Send everything to the main project on the meeting. Models and levels will be lost. What will we do? Recreate them?
 
: TODO - SISTEMA DE CUSTSCENE
